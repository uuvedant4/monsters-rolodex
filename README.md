# ***Monsters Rolodex***

This is Monsters Rolodex web application.
A simple create-react-app (command line utility of ReactJS) with some cards and a search box.
The user can search by typing a card name and the results are produced in a real-time way based on the characters the user is typing!
A good demonstration of the component and state usage inside ReactJS.
Every component must be simple and it should be doing one task well.
State uplifting should be used when we want to inform different components down in the hierarchy of state changes.
